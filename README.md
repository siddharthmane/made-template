Integrated Analysis of Healthcare Infrastructure: Exploring the Interplay Between Hospital Beds and Preventive/Rehabilitation Facilities

## Description
This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of healthcare infrastructure by exploring the interplay between the number of hospital beds and preventive/rehabilitation facilities. Leveraging two datasets, "Number of hospitals and beds by type of institution" and "Number of preventive or rehabilitation facilities and beds set up by selected specialist department," our goal is to gain insights into the distribution and correlation of these essential components within the healthcare system.
