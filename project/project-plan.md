# Project Plan

## Title
Integrated Analysis of Healthcare Infrastructure

## Main Question

1. What is the geographical distribution of hospitals and preventive/rehabilitation facilities, and how does the availability of hospital beds correlate with the presence of preventive/rehabilitation services?

2. How do the numbers of hospital beds and the presence of preventive/rehabilitation facilities vary across different specialist departments, and what insights can be drawn regarding the allocation of resources in specialized healthcare services?

## Description

This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of healthcare infrastructure by exploring the interplay between the number of hospital beds and preventive/rehabilitation facilities. Leveraging two datasets, "Number of hospitals and beds by type of institution" and "Number of preventive or rehabilitation facilities and beds set up by selected specialist department," our goal is to gain insights into the distribution and correlation of these essential components within the healthcare system.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Number of hospitals and beds by type of institution - Independent cities and districts 
* Metadata URL: https://www.govdata.de/ckan/dataset/anzahl-der-krankenhauser-und-aufgestellte-betten-nach-artder-trager-kreisfreie-stadte-und-kreis-1.rdf
* Data URL: https://www.landesdatenbank.nrw.de/ldbnrwws/downloader/00/tables/23111-01d_00.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset titled "Number of Hospitals and Beds by Type of Institution - Independent Cities and Districts"  provides information on the healthcare infrastructure in independent cities and districts. The data includes details about the number of hospitals, their types, and the corresponding bed capacities in these regions. The data is specific to independent cities and districts, indicating a focus on healthcare facilities within administrative divisions that operate autonomously.


### Datasource2: Number of preventive or rehabilitation facilities and beds set up by selected specialist departments -independent cities and districts 
* Metadata URL:  https://www.govdata.de/ckan/dataset/anzahl-der-vorsorge-oder-rehabilitationseinrichtungen-undaufgestellte-betten-nach-ausgewah-2018.rdf
* Data URL: https://www.landesdatenbank.nrw.de/ldbnrwws/downloader/00/tables/23112-04i_00.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset focuses on healthcare facilities that specialize in preventive care or rehabilitation services. These services are designed to prevent health issues or assist individuals in recovering from illnesses or medical procedures.
